ORM
===

For a cursory overview of ORM, see :ref:`orm`.

As these examples use the ORM tables and, thus, import them, the scripts should
individually work. If you run into issues however, please execute the scripts in their
numerical order, as also given in the list below:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   create_tables
   single_entry
   multiple_entries
